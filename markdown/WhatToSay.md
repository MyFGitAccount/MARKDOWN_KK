# Key Point

## Problem to tackle
- Define real-world problem your project aim to address.
- This should be supported by valid references, such as:
  - news articles
  - technical papers
  - industry reports
  - relevant academic sources  
  to demonstrate the relevance and importance of the problem.

## Project Goals and Objective
- Outline the specific goals and measurable objectives that your project intends to achieve.
- Additionally, suggest methods to evaluate the completeness of your project, such as:
  - developing test cases
  - performance metrics
  - validation criteria  
  that will be used to demonstrate whether the project meets its intended goals and functions as expected.

## Project Feasibility and Proposed Solution
- Discuss the project's feasibility, considering factors such as:
  - technical viability
  - budget constraints
  - time management
- Present the proposed solutions in detail, explaining how they address the identified problem.

## Schedule
- Provide a detailed timeline outlining the key milestones and deliverables of your project.
- Treat April as the final project deadline — approximately six months from the beginning of Semester 1.
- Include specific deadlines for each phase of the project.
- The schedule should also account for potential risks or delays, with contingency plans in place to ensure that the project remains on track and is completed by the late April deadline.

## Resources allocation
- Detail how resources will be allocated to ensure the successful completion of the project.
- This includes:
  - assigning specific roles and responsibilities to group members
  - identifying necessary materials, tools, and equipment
  - managing any financial resources or budget constraints

# Reminder

- Clearly outlined the problem being addressed, the proposed solution, and the plan for project execution
- Strong idea, prototype and demonstrations
- Should choose a project scope that can be delivered within two semesters
- Should demonstrate originality or solve a meaningful problem

## Grade reflects not only on the prototype/demo but also:
- Quality of the presentation
- Clarity of your presentation
- Evidence of teamwork & contribution

> ⚠️ But failure to present a preliminary prototype or testing evidence will result in a significant downgrade in the relevant assessments

## Citation & Purchase Notes
- Cite all resources you use (even purchased kits)
- Explain clearly to your supervisor the purpose of any purchase and how it is adapted in your project
